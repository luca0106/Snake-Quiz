# 🐍 Snake Game — Educational Project

This project is an interactive implementation of the classic Snake game, developed as part of the European project:

“Fostering the Transversal Digital Competences in Higher Education” (Acronym: FTDCHE)
Ref. Project: 2022-1-ES01-KA220-HED-000089861

### 📘 Project Leader: University of Malaga (Spain)
### 🤝 Partners: National University of Science and Technology Politehnica Bucharest (UNSTPB, Romania),
### University of Primorska (Slovenia), and UCLL University of Applied Sciences (Belgium)

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The project aims to foster transversal digital competences in higher education by encouraging students to create interactive applications that combine logic, creativity, and web technologies.

The Snake Game was designed as a fun and educational project to demonstrate essential web programming concepts such as animations, user input, and event-driven design.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

🖼️ HTML5 Canvas — for rendering the game board and animations

🎨 CSS3 — using neon and gradient styling for a modern look

⚙️ JavaScript (Vanilla) — for game logic, controls, and interactivity

🐍 Python — used to run a simple local web server

## 🚀 Main Features

- Smooth, real-time snake movement

- Random food generation and snake growth

- Score and lives tracking

- Automatic reset and game-over logic

- Modern neon-style interface

## 💡 Educational Objectives

- Strengthen understanding of front-end web technologies

- Apply canvas-based graphics and event-driven programming

- Practice algorithmic thinking and interactive design

- Encourage creativity in user interface development

## 🧠 How to Run the Game

- Open a terminal in the game folder.

- Start the local Python server by running:

  <pre> ```bash python -m http.server 8000 ``` </pre>


- Open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:8000/index.html


- The game will load in your browser and can be played directly from the local server.
